# Blazor Project for Movie Dataset

This is a sample Blazor web application with EF Core (ASP.NET Core in .NET 9). The setup follows the [Mircosoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-1?view=aspnetcore-9.0&pivots=vs) and the [DevOps tutorial](https://dev.to/kenakamu/devops-blazor-webassembly-solution-part-1-add-unit-test-projects-and-use-testhost-5g2k).
